My Wife really wanted one of those expensive full featured spin bikes but didn't want to fork out $2K so she found a blog (https://www.mypursestrings.com/peloton-app/) that hacked together the same bike for a quarter of the cost. The only issue was that it didn't account for  monitoring resistance so I decided to build her a resistance monitor myself using Arduino on some Adafruit Huzzah boards I had lying around the house and a cheap Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR) off amazon.<br/><br/>

Update: added a link to a 100 lbs (45kg) FSR because a larger pressure range was needed. Have not tested the new higher pressure FSR myself.
